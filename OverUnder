%% Over Under Computer Game
% Description: This is a single player game in which a user inputs a guess
% of whether a random number will be over or under another random number.
% This mini game can be played as many times as the user wants until they
% are satisfied.

% Define Variables:
gameDecision = "yes";
overUnderDecision = "";
balanceAmount = 0;
wagerAmount = 0;
subsequentGame = "yes";

% Welcome user to game, explain the rules, and ask if they want to play, if
% yes, ask how much they want to play with
